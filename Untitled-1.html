                it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - <br>
                they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - <br>
                they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world.<br>
                 As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them -<br>
                  actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up,<br>
                   you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything.<br>
                    Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always,<br>
                     always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up,<br>
                      and most importantly, keep smiling,<br>
                 because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about</li></ul></p></div></font>
